# Tool-Shed-System
## Tool is an ADT that models a tool in a community tool library. A tool has a name, and a 
## number representing the number of the tool currently in the community tool library. People in 
## the community can borrow tools from the community tool library. When a person borrows a 
## tool from the tool library, his/her name is added into a borrower list of the tool; and when a 
## person returns a tool that he/she borrowed from the tool library, his/her name is removed from 
## the borrower list. As a result, the tool ADT has a data structure to store a list of borrowers, an 
## operation to add a borrower to the borrower list, an operation to remove a borrower from the 
## borrower list, etc.  It is assumed in this assignment that tool names are unique.  
## ToolCollection is another ADT, which is used to store and manipulate a collection of tools.  
## The data structure used in the ToolCollection ADT to store all tools in the community tool 
## library is a Binary Search Tree (BST). A node of the BST is modelled by a class, namely 
## BTreeNode. The BTreeNode class has three fields, left child reference (lchild), right child 
## reference (rchild) as well as a reference to a tool object.  

## ToolCollection is another ADT, which is used to store and manipulate a collection of tools.  
## The data structure used in the ToolCollection ADT to store all tools in the community tool 
## library is a Binary Search Tree (BST). A node of the BST is modelled by a class, namely 
## BTreeNode. The BTreeNode class has three fields, left child reference (lchild), right child 
## reference (rchild) as well as a reference to a tool object.
